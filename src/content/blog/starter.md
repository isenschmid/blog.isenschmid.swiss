Hello there! This is the very start of my blog. I am Noah and a Microsoft 365 and PowerShell enthusiast.
Join me on my journey of sharing knowledge!

What are the first topics on which I will share my insights?

- Automating Microsoft 365 License Assignments with PowerShell
- Conditional Access: What you actually (don't) need.
- A few insights of my initial contact with PIM (Priviledged Identity Management)
