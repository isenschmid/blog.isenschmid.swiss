  <h3>why a blog</h3>
	<p>In IT, you constantly acquire new knowledge — and I believe it shouldn't just stay locked away in your head. Instead of keeping my thoughts, experiences, and insights to myself, I decided to start this blog to share what I've learned and hopefully help others along the way.</p>
	<p>Here, you'll find content about Microsoft technologies, security, automation, and general IT topics that I come across during my journey.</p>

	<h3>career</h3>
	<p>I'm at the very start of my IT career. I completed my four-year apprenticeship in July 2025 and now work as a System Engineer in the greater Bern area, Switzerland.</p>
	<p>The days of saying, “When I grow up, I want to be a farmer,” are behind me — but my ambitions are clearer than ever. I'm currently working on my Microsoft certifications with the goal of becoming a Modern Workplace Engineer, focusing on security and automation.</p>
	<p>I'm especially passionate about the Microsoft Enterprise ecosystem — from Azure and security to endpoint management and server administration. My goal is to keep growing, stay curious, and share my journey here with anyone who's interested.</p>

	<h3>what's next</h3>
	<p>This blog is not just about documenting what I learn — it's also about connecting with others. Over time, I plan to share:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Tips, guides, and best practices from my daily work.</li>
		<li>Insights into Microsoft technologies and security.</li>
		<li>Lessons learned from real-world projects.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you're into IT, security, automation, or simply enjoy following someone's journey through tech, stick around — there's a lot more to come! 🚀</p>

	<h3>what's up with the blog name</h3>
	<p>The name of my blog, “The Ironsmith Method,” comes from a little play on my last name — Isenschmid, which literally translates to “Ironsmith” in English. It has nothing to do with the actual profession — it’s simply a small personal touch that connects the blog to who I am.</p>

	<h3>what's up with the mascot</h3>
	<p>The mascot is a modernized version of my family’s coat of arms. It’s designed to represent an ironsmith — but with a twist: he’s an IT guy, just like me 😉</p>
